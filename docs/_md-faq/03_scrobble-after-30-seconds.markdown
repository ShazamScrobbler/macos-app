q: How do you actually make sure that a scrobble has been played more than 30 seconds?
a: We don't. We have to make assumptions as the Shazam app doesn't tell for how long a track have been played. However, when Shazam tags more than one song within 30 seconds, it means than the first song wasn't played long enough and only the next song will be scrobbled.
