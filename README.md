SBShazamScrobbler
=================

Shazam Desktop Scrobbler for Mac OS X.

### If you would love to:

 - scrobble the songs played at your place by your roommates, family or girlfriend,
 - scrobble songs from a mix,
 - scrobble your vinyles (finally!),
 - scrobble the radio,
 - scrobble the OST of a movie,
 - scrobble music from a game (i.e. GTA radios).
 
The Shazam Desktop Scrobbler is for you!

### How does it work?

It works together with the [Shazam Mac App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shazam/id897118787?mt=12). When Shazam tags a song being played around you, the Shazam Scrobbler will take care of scrobbling them to [Last.fm](last.fm).

### Problems & fixes

#### Problems w/o fixes

- The Shazam Mac app won't tag songs being played on your headphones,
- Shazam doesn't always find the right tag for a song (especially in DJ mixes).

#### Problems w/ fixes

- What if you are already scrobbling —with another scrobbler— a song that Shazam detects?
 - TODO: we check if Last.fm is already "Scrobbling from X",
 - TODO: we check if the song has already been scrobbled in the last 5 minutes.
- How to make sure that the song tagged by Shazam were played longer than 30 seconds?
 - TODO: reset Shazam tags after each tag, then get the same tag again and again until we know if the song were played long enough.
