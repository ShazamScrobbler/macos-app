SBShazamScrobbler
=================

Shazam Desktop Scrobbler for Mac OS X.

### If you would love to:

 - scrobble the songs played at your place by your roommates, family or girlfriend,
 - scrobble songs from a mix,
 - scrobble your vinyles (finally!),
 - scrobble the radio.
 
The Shazam Desktop Scrobbler is for you!

### How does it work?

It works together with the [Shazam Mac App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shazam/id897118787?mt=12). When Shazam tags a song being played around you, the Shazam Scrobbler will take care of scrobbling them to [Last.fm](last.fm).

### Problems

- The Shazam Mac app won't tag songs being played on your headphones,
- What if you already scrobbling a song that Shazam detects?
- Shazam doesn't always find the right tag for a song (especially in DJ mixes).

### Next

We would love having this for mobiles, we could:
- Scrobble from a nightclub, a bar,
- Scrobble from the radio in your car,
